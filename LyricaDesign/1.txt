Pick up your phone, put on your coat,

everyone’s looking up at you

Push through the crowd and into the sound

of everyone talking about you

Don’t be afraid, honey one day this will fade

So put on a smile, do it in style,

make them all desperate to be you



Don’t think twice

Give yourself to another night

Hold on tight

Hope that you make it out alive

We are the beautiful ones



It’s just a phase, you’re not to blame

for everyone trying to please you

But you’re too young to come undone

so don’t let them try to deceive you

Don’t be ashamed, honey one day this will fade

So put on your coat, give them a show,

make them all desperate to be you



Don’t think twice

Give yourself to another night

Hold on tight

Hope that you make it out alive

We are the beautiful ones



We are the, we are the

We are the beautiful ones



Don’t think twice

Give yourself to another night

Hold on tight

Hope that you make it out alive

We are the beautiful ones



Beautiful, so beautiful



We are the beautiful ones
